This project helps businesses make data-driven decisions through comprehensive data analysis.

## **Features**

- **Database Schema Design**: Create tables for customers, products, sales, and regions.
- **Data Insertion**: Populate tables with sample data to simulate realistic sales scenarios.
- **Sales Performance Analysis**: Calculate total sales by product, top customers, and sales trends over time.
- **Regional Sales Insights**: Analyze sales by region to understand geographical performance.
- **Product Category Analysis**: Evaluate sales based on product categories to identify high-performing segments.
